				<blockquote>
					"Instead of looking upon life as a contest, it becomes a dance, it becomes a game — one doesn’t withdraw from it, one doesn’t stop living, but one goes into the game so that these revolving fishes are no longer trying to eat each other, but they’re just going around dancing, having the biggest fun in the world."
