				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<p class="about-para">
				 	My name is Lindsay Wreford Rennie, I was born in East London on the 4th of March 1978. I attended Selborne School from Grade 1 through to Grade 12, thereafter I pursued the study of a B.PROC Law Degree at the University of Port Elizabeth. I was employed by the justice department for three years before I realised that my true passion lay with dealing with people so I left the law and moved into a Customer Relations position at DHL, I spent 4 years with DHL before being offered shares in a Retail Liquor store which I accepted with open arms. I am happy to say that after joining Bay Liquor in February 2002 I am still here and going strong - loving my dealings with all my customers who mostly have become friends.

				<h2>Motivation behind the whiskies</h2>

				<p class ="about-para">
					Having been an avid Captain Morgan and Coke fan - I was invited to go to a Whisky tasting...... what an experience and absolute life changer.... To be honest I was under the impression that all Whisky tasted the same - little did I know just how wrong and naieve I had been. I now had a new mission, to purchase a different bottle or age statement of whisky per month and allow my taste buds to lead me to my niche brand. In doing so I soon came to realize that whisky was tantamount to a religion to the people in the know and as I started to rub shoulders with fellow whisky enthusiasts I was drawn deeper into the history of whisky, its origins and different ageing procedures... I also realized that there were many people like me who had a passion for the occasional dram however being in a small town didnt have the ways or means of getting their hands on "THE GOOD STUFF", and so I found a niche in the market that would be fantastic to service and be of interest to me.

				</p>

				<h2>my vision for the future</h2>

				<p class="about-para">
					My vision for the near future is to open my own unique whisky store where I can showcase whiskies from different regions of the world, as well as to offer tastings, informative talks and to bring my excitement for whisky to people who may never have experienced it.I would like to get the message across that whisky is a very versatile as well as extremely interesting drink and not a product that has been "LABELLED"as a rich older generation drink - basicaly to change people of ages from 18 and ups perception of the product.
